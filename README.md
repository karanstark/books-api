Book-API is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express that allows you to manage a collection of books. It supports basic CRUD operations — Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT), and Delete (DELETE). Currently, the PUT (Update) operation is not working as expected on some platforms like Postman due to issues with reading the request body — this is a known issue and currently in progress to be fixed. The rest of the API functions work correctly and serve as a solid foundation for learning Express-based API development.
